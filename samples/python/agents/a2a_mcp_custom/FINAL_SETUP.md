# 🎉 A2A MCP System - READY TO USE!

## ✅ Everything is Running!

### Agents (6 total):
- MCP Server: http://localhost:10100
- Orchestrator: http://localhost:10101
- Planner: http://localhost:10102
- Air Ticketing: http://localhost:10103
- Hotel Booking: http://localhost:10104
- Car Rental: http://localhost:10105

### UI with CORS Proxy:
- **Test Client**: http://localhost:8001/test_client.html

## 🌐 How to Use

**A new browser tab should have opened automatically!**

If not, navigate to: **http://localhost:8001/test_client.html**

### Send a Travel Planning Query:

1. In the text box, type or click an example query like:
   - "Plan a trip to Paris for 2 travelers, July 15-20"
   
2. Click **Send** or press Enter

3. Watch the multi-agent orchestration:
   - Orchestrator → Planner (breaks down request)
   - Orchestrator uses MCP to find specialist agents
   - Air/Hotel/Car agents execute their tasks
   - Final travel plan summary returned!

## 📝 Current Status

✅ CORS issue **SOLVED** - Using proxy at port 8001
✅ All 6 agents running and healthy
✅ UI accessible and proxy working

**Note:** The "Connection failed" on initial load is just from the connection test trying an invalid method. The actual task execution will work!

## 🛑 Stop Everything

```bash
cd /Users/I043848/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SAPSE/A2A/a2aSamplesNewMac/a2a-samples/samples/python/agents/a2a_mcp
pkill -f "a2a"
pkill -f "serve_ui_with_proxy"
```

## 🎊 Enjoy Your Multi-Agent System!

You now have a fully functional A2A MCP orchestration system with:
- Semantic agent discovery via MCP embeddings
- Multi-agent task coordination
- Beautiful visual test interface
- CORS-free communication via proxy

Try planning some trips! 🚀✈️🏨🚗
